 FLASH ALERT! 
 AIMSI Technologies, Inc. Signs U.S. Sales Agreement with Advanced Global
Security, LLC., whose CEO is _FORMER CONGRESSMAN _, Steve Stockman. 
Click for Press Release:
 LINK[] 
Growth Equity Corp. has discovered a diamond in the rough that is being
polished to a brilliant shine. As with everything in the market, _ _timing is
everything_ _ _!_ We are excited to have found this opportunity to buy in
advance of the market demand. Read on to find out why we are so confident of
this stock pick being a Huge Winner. 
(OTCBB: AIMT )
No Pump and Dump here. AIMSI Technologies Inc. (OTCBB: AIMT ) is a solid
company with an exciting future.
 In business over 10 years, profitable each year.
 Exclusive worldwide distribution rights for the Automatic Large Area Remote Mapper (ALARM). A cutting edge technology patented by the University of Alabama at Huntsville , that can detect radioactive dirty bombs, chemical and biological threats.
 Signed $225 million dollar contract for the ALARM with China Global Distribution Corp. This contract alone should generate over $100 million dollars in profit to AIMT, and that's _just in Asia_ _._ 
 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has a $44 billion dollar budget, and AIMT is well positioned to tap into this budget with contracts that may dwarf the Asian contract. 
 Press
ReleaseLINK[] 
 ALARM units already in production, first units passed rigorous testing by highly regarded Oak Ridge Labs in Tennessee .
LATEST NEWS IS BEST OF ALL!_ _ 
 Savvy investors say this latest press release is  _stronger than a garlic
milkshake_ . 
Reginald Hall, Chairman and CEO, has revised his employment agreement with the
company. He is so excited and confident about the future growth prospects of
the company, that he has canceled over 36 million shares previously issued
to him, and has agreed to receive _compensation based on future performance
of the company._ 
 See Press Release:LINK[] 
Since this represents more than half of the issued and outstanding shares of
stock in the company, it won't take the market long to realize that the price
per share should double in value.
 _That's good news but it gets better!_ 
At the same time Mr. Hall cancelled his stock, the company approved a 5 for 1
forward stock split. The company felt that a growth stock is much more
attractive to investors at a lower price. ( _Notwithstanding the company's
intention to apply soon for a listing on the American Stock Exchange; AMEX.
 ) Remember, this stock is undervalued by at least 50% because the
outstanding shares have been reduced by 50%.
 _Press Release:_ LINK[ / pz/041029/66580.html] 
 This stock will not go unnoticed long. We predict this stock will soar to
the $6.00 to $8.00 dollar/share range by the end of the year!!! 
 Timing is perfect 
  The Homeland Security sector is hot. 
  Company fundamentals are sound, with strong leadership. 
  Best of all, this company has structured its stock for tremendous
growth.

are so confident of this stock pick being a Huge Winner. 
(OTCBB: AIMT )
No Pump and Dump here. AIMSI Technologies Inc. (OTCBB: AIMT ) is a solid
company with an exciting future.
 In business over 10 years, profitable each year.
 Exclusive worldwide distribution rights for the Automatic Large Area Remote Mapper (ALARM). A cutting edge technology patented by the University of Alabama at Huntsville , that can detect radioactive dirty bombs, chemical and biological threats.
 Signed $225 million dollar contract for the ALARM with China Global Distribution Corp. This contract alone should generate over $100 million dollars in profit to AIMT, and that's _just in_ _Asia_ _ . _ _ 
 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has a $44 billion dollar budget, and AIMT is well positioned to tap into this budget with contracts that may dwarf the Asian contract.
 ALARM units already in production, first units passed rigorous testing by highly regarded Oak Ridge Labs in Tennessee .
CEO NEWS IS BEST OF ALL!_ _ 
 Savvy investors say this CEO MOVE is  _stronger_ _ than a garlic
milkshake _ . 
Reginald Hall, Chairman and CEO, has revised his employment agreement with the
company. He is so excited and confident about the future growth prospects of
the company, that he has canceled over 36 million shares previously issued
to him, and has agreed to receive _ compensation based on future performance
of the company. 
 See Press Release:LINK[] 
Since this represents more than half of the issued and outstanding shares of
stock in the company, it won't take the market long to realize that the price
per share should double in value.
 That's good news but it gets better! 
At the same time Mr. Hall cancelled his stock, the company approved a 5 for 1
forward stock split. The company felt that a growth stock is much more
attractive to investors at a lower price. ( _ Notwithstanding the company's
intention to apply soon for a listing on the American Stock Exchange; AMEX.
) _ Remember, this stock is undervalued by at least 50% because the
outstanding shares have been reduced by 50%.
 Press Release: 
 LINK[] 
 This stock will not go unnoticed long. We predict this stock will soar to
the $6.00 to $8.00 dollar/share range by the end of the year!!! 
 Timing is perfect 
  The Homeland Security sector is hot. 
  Company fundamentals are sound, with strong leadership. 
  Best of all, this company has structured its stock for tremendous
growth.

Your credit/debit card information must be updated 
 
 
Dear eBay Member, 
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used
by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your
account while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by
you. 
 
 The login attempt was made from: 
 IP address: 172.25.210.66 
 ISP Host: cache 66.proxy.aol.com
By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our
users provide us when they register on the Site. However, because user
verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does not confirm
each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline
verification system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing with. 
 
 
 
 click on the link below, fill the form and then submit as we will
verify

 Please Note: If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice
but to temporally suspend your account.

Your credit/debit card information must be updated 
 
 
Dear eBay Member, 
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in to your eBay account from a
foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was used
by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed your
account while traveling, the unusual login attempts may have been initiated by
you. 
 
 The login attempt was made from: 
 IP address: 172.25.210.66 
 ISP Host: cache 66.proxy.aol.com
By now, we used many techniques to verify the accuracy of the information our
users provide us when they register on the Site. However, because user
verification on the Internet is difficult, eBay cannot and does not confirm
each user's purported identity. Thus, we have established an offline
verification system to help you evaluate with whom you are dealing with.

"OBDP is more than just the average EBay drop off company
 
LINK[] 
 
 
A new phenomenon called EBay drop off stores is sweeping the globe. EBay
estimates that sales through drop off stores may reach $10 Billion per year,
which would yield $700 Million in revenues to eBay . (NashvilleCityPaper.com,
03/10/04 )
EBay drop off stores are tapping into an untouched market: people who want to
sell on eBay but don't have the time, or don't want the hassle of
photographing their items, listing them online, answering buyers' questions
and shipping what's sold. ( Miami Herald.com 04/31/04 )
 Orbit Drop, Inc. (OBDP:PK) is a EBay drop off company with 4 company owned stores in Texas , 1 in Paris France and currently offering franchising. 
 OBDP is more than just the average EBay drop off company. OBDP has
created multiple revenue streams to form a solid foundation for the
 Company to offer franchising and future expansion. These revenue streams
will be apparent as OBDP updates its financials.
 1. US and International Company owned stores 
 2. US and International franchising and licensing 
 3. The purchase of Success Direct TV and its revenues 
 4. Private Labeling 
 5. Drop off store acquisitions

 OBDP 's first shipment of 50,000 out of 200,000 pieces of Von Dutch hats, t shirts and jeans has a retail value of $1,250,000. 
 OBDP 's acquisition Success Direct TV makes sense because of the visibility of the products and the international advertising expertise. This will only help OBDP 's visibility and on line marketing revenues and assets. 
 OBDP 's is currently taking applications for area developers and franchisees. 
 The iFranchise Group prides itself on client selectivity and has worked with such companies as Ace Hardware, Chevron, McDonald's and many more. (LINK[])

 Dear eBay Member: 
Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, 
eBay is introducing a new account verification method. From time to time, 
Randomly selected accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced
verification process based on our merchant Accounts/bank relations and
customers credit card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed
copies of one or more photo ID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if
your credit card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit
card number, billing address etc. without notifying us about the change.
Subject of this verification process are also the accounts that have unpaid
dues to eBay. 
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this
message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your
eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized
account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay policy to
represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation
of local, national, and/or international law. eBay is committed to assist law
enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal
information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be
provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that
perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
 Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might be
because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that the
account was not updated at all.

"Paypal; Received $2,000USD
You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on the
Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. I made
over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my final year of
marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my health. During this
time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated huge successful
down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In the end all I had to
do to ""earn"" was send a few emails to my targeted databases and watch the
viral action spread across 10's of thousands people on the Web. Each one made
me money. Consider me as one of those illusive ""top earners"" that you hear
about but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest companies
enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers with a ""bang"". I
have also been engaged to create and deploy aggressive email marketing
campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the largest businesses that you may
be involved with right now too. I have been involved at the top of many of the
largest m'l'm, network m'ktg and other business programs and have earned
unimaginable over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always
been at the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal high
response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on a first come,
first served basis. You too could find yourself at the top earning amounts
that other ""top earners"" and I have earned and in a very short time too. All
you need is a good business and one of my databases. All of my high impact
databases will deliver you thousands of valuable very active people to market
any m'l'm/network mktg/other similar program. Buy one from me and get joinups
and customers enrolled into your business providing you mention my company
name to then when promoting your business. You no longer have to market, pay
to advertise, submit, opt in, promote or learn ""how to do"" anything ever
again. This will definitely revolutionise the way you work and make you
succeed. I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500 people and
will only honour that number of orders. This is the easiest and fastest way to
develop a cash rich down line and profit generating customer base. You are not
going to experience this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can
be 100% sure of. I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. This is
no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information plus my
telephone number so you can call me direct. Please send an email to:
777curt100@tiscali.co.uk with @more@ in the subject line and I will send you
additional details to include great prices and a list of incredible data that
I have plus my contact telephone number to call me on. If you think I have
breached your privacy and you would like to request me to cancel any other

"Pay.pal. Funds have been deposited today $2268.24
You may or may not have heard of me however I've been marketing on the
Internet for over 8 years now and have done extremely well for myself. I made
over $2,000,000 (2 million USD) in just a couple of months of my final year of
marketing which was a period when I scaled down due to my health. During this
time on the Internet I joined many companies and generated huge successful
down lines and databases of highly active marketers. In the end all I had to
do to ""earn"" was send a few emails to my targeted databases and watch the
viral action spread across 10's of thousands people on the Web. Each one made
me money. Consider me as one of those illusive ""top_earners"" that you hear
about but never have had the luck of bringing into your own down line. I am
one of the successful mystery marketers that many of the biggest companies
enrol into their own top tier to rapidly populate other tiers with a ""bang"". I
have also been engaged to create and deploy aggressive email marketing
campaigns to fill lower tiers for some of the largest businesses that you may
be involved with right now too. I have been involved at the top of many of the
largest m'l'm, network m'ktg and other business programs and have earned
unimaginable over rides and ongoing profit. For the last 7 years I have always
been at the top enjoying the many benefits and huge profit made off other
people's work. However because of my health I am selling my personal high
response databases to a limited number of people for cheap on a first come,
first served basis. You too could find yourself at the top earning amounts
that other ""top_earners"" and I have earned and in a very short time too. All
you need is a good business and one of my databases. All of my high impact
databases will deliver you thousands of valuable very active people to market
any m l m/network mkt'g/other similar program. Buy one from me and get joinups
and customers enrolled into your business providing you mention my company
name to then when promoting your business. You no longer have to market, pay
to advertise, submit, opt in, promote or learn ""how to do"" anything ever
again. This will definitely revolutionise the way you work and make you
succeed. I am not going to give this extremely valuable chance to everyone who
responds to my email. I have only enough resources to provide 500 people and
will only honour that number of orders. This is the easiest and fastest way to
develop a cash rich down line and profit generating customer base. You are not
going to experience this ever again in the rest of your life and that you can
be 100% sure of. I can even arrange to send the promo emails for you. This is
no joke, reply to my email and I will send you more information plus my
telephone number so you can call me direct. Please send an email to:

Due to recent activity, including possible unauthorised transactions placed on
your

tampered with, please visit the [Resolution Center so that we can provide
additional 
information and work with you to resolve this issue.
We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the

We 
apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause you and we would
like 
to thank you for your cooperation as we review this matter.

We ask that you allow at least 72 hours for the

 Confirm Your Bank Account 
 
 
 
This is a reminder that we need you to confirm your bank account. This bank
account was added to your PayPal account and will be end in 15/06/2005 . 
 
 
 
 How To Confirm Your Bank Account 
 
LINK[].gif) 
PayPal has made two small deposits into the bank account you registered. These
deposits should appear in your bank account in 2 4 business days. 
LINK[].gif) 
[Call your bank to find out your 2
deposit amounts from
PayPal]
 LINK[].gif)
 Step 1: Call your bank, use your ATM statement, or go to your online
bank account to find out what the exact amounts of these two deposits are.
You can also check your paper bank statement for these amounts. They will be
listed as deposits from PayPal. 
LINK[].gif) 
[Enter the exact amounts of the 2
deposits into your PayPal
account]
 LINK[].gif)
 Step 2: Go to LINK[ bin/webscr?cmd=login run] log in to your PayPal account.
Complecte your ""Bank Account"" information and ""Activate Account"". 
LINK[].gif)
 LINK[].gif)
 LINK[].gif) 
 
 
 
 Why Confirm Your Bank Account? 
 
LINK[].gif) 
 It increases security 
When you enter the two amounts that PayPal deposited into your bank account,
you confirm that you are the owner of this bank account. This is because only
you as the owner would have access to the exact amounts of the 2 deposits
PayPal sent. This process increases the safety of the entire PayPal payments
network. 
LINK[].gif) 
 Your PayPal account will become verified 
Your PayPal account becomes verified once you confirm your bank account. With
a verified account, there is no limit on the amount of money you can send
through PayPal when you choose to make these payments using funds from your
bank account. 
 
LINK[].gif) 
 Your $2,000.00 USD sending limit will be removed 
Once you confirm your bank account, your sending limit will be lifted and
there will be no limit on the amount of money you can send through PayPal
using your bank account funds. 
 
 
 
 Protect Your Password 
 
LINK[].gif) 
Never give your password to anyone and only log in at
LINK[ bin/webscr?cmd=login run] . If anyone asks for your password,
please follow the Security Tips instructions on the PayPal website.

widespread damage, but not until 2007.
