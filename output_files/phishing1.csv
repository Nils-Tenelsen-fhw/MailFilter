some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti fraud 
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity. 
 
Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your

features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please 
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection. 
 
Case ID Number: PP 040 187 541 
 
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible. 
Should access to your account remain limited for an extended period of 
time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.` 
However, failure to restore your records will result in account suspension. 
Please update your records on or before July 27, 2005 .

The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal
agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions. NCUA, backed of the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit
Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insuring the savings of 80 million account
holders in all federal credit unions and many state chartered credit unions.
During the 1990s and into the 21st century, credit unions have been healthy
and growing. Credit union failures remain low and the Share Insurance Fund
maintains a healthy equity level. 
 
 
 
 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a
safe environment for over 80 million account holders in all federal credit
unions and many state chartered credit unions. Protecting the security of
holders account and of the Federal Credit Unions (FCU) network is our
primary concern. To protect the security of your account, NCUA employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti fraud
teams regularly scan the federal credit unions systems for unusual activity.
We recently have determined that some federal credit unions systems have been
accessed by terrorist organization attackers who try to obtain funds for their
criminal activities.
Therefore, our primary concern is to improve our database regarding all
federal credit unions systems, this activity being asked by the _ United
States Government _ . 
 
 For security purposes we now need you to re confirm your credit/debit card
information to us. If this is not completed in 48 hours, we will be forced to
suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent and
terrorist purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. 
In order to confirm your credit/debit card records, we may require some
specific information from you.

request: Please follow the Member Verification Procedure (Second Notice) 
 
 
Dear eBay Member, 
 
Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing
a new account verification method. From time to time, randomly selected
accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced verification
process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations and customers credit
card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or
more photo ID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit
card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit card number,
billing address etc. without letting us know about the change. 
Subject of this verification process are also the accounts that have unpaid
dues to eBay. 
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this
message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your
eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized
account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay policy to
represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation
of local, national, and/or international law. eBay is committed to assist law
enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal
information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be
provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that
perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
 Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might be

submitted your credit card number to the faked ""Amazon.com"" web site, we
advise that you take steps to protect your information by notifying your
credit card company. Additionally, you should delete that credit card from
your Amazon.com account to prevent anyone from improperly regaining access to
your account. To do so, click the link in your Seller Account to ""Change your
Amazon.com store wide settings such as e mail, address book, and 1 Click.""
Then click ""Edit or delete a credit card"" under Payment Settings in Your
