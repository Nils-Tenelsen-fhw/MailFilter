Hello,

Hi, I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So,
I'm carrying an ""icon"" where it says ""I am a member since less than 30 days"".
A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a
positive feedback. But still, mine's got a ""zero"" feedback? Why is it that? If
I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback. But the feedback
counting doesn't go from zero to one. Is it because I'm a member who's been
registered for less than 30 days?.  
  
Regards,  
Gretta.

Hello,

Hi, I signed up for Ebay and I've been an Ebay member for about 15 days. So,
I'm carrying an ""icon"" where it says ""I am a member since less than 30 days"".
A few days ago, I managed to sell an item. The guy who bought mine left me a
positive feedback. But still, mine's got a ""zero"" feedback? Why is it that? If
I click on my profile, I can see that he left me a feedback. But the feedback
counting doesn't go from zero to one. Is it because I'm a member who's been
registered for less than 30 days?.  
  
Regards,  
Gretta.

"HSBC BANK

Good day, I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC
Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he
placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully
request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the
integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted
you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this
communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe
would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to
engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed
us that he had a financial portfolio of Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And
Fifty Thousand United States Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to
have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his
case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto
chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the
volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions
prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various
growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers
is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and
2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first
months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at
over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential
of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid
2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an
urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here
in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to
have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have
to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash
movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of
9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed
his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the
London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate
Securities Co is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net
worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or
undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and
highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was
deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the
money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This
was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th June 2003. In
June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that
the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as
far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking
sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities
Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim
his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately
passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of
HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our
client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a
heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify
the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an
investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation
and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private
banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity,
but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-
data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening
an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the
accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having
their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no
traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in
most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a
testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have
passed away, we instituted our own Investigations in good faith to determine
who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past
months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private
investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is
this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a
possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the
only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the
results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of
names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or
identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full
picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the
late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, Corporate Securities
Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements
of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably
revert the deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the
HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of
the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to
understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds
the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain
offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put
together the general direction of what I propose. I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to
do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is
concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the
funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the
file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has
no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward.
This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to
track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and have found no
family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar
details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in a position to
instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest
surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the
money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin
and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would
have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn
a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you
that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply
inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I
will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct
them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The
alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds
to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for
you to think of receiving the money from Corp orate Securities Co. We can
fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of
this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you
should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive.
If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever
contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my
proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums
out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be
hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I
make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I
cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of
my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my
chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my
life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it
is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk
I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am
the only one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a
name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share
the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through
this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this
process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me
via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I
repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do
I wouldn�t you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me
only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email
address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines
are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of
customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe
this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a
wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to
what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing
gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.
This is the one truth I have learnt from my private banking clients. Do not
betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting,
soon. I await your response. Daniel Cole. N/B Kindly send your response to my
direct email address:dan833@katamail.com

Valued Netbank User,  
  
In recent months there has been a significant upsurge in the number of users
of the Netbank service.  
As a result there has also been an upsurge in the number of dormant accounts
that have not been used for significant periods of time originating from users
who no longer use our service. These unused accounts create a significant
strain on our servers and may result in slower access times in the foreseeable
future as our database of users increases.  
As a result to separate the active accounts from the dormant ones we are
requiring all Netbank users to renewal their accounts. **  
  
You can do this by LINK[Clicking Here] to renewal your account**.  
  
Failure to do so may result in temporary cessation of your Netbank account
that will necessitate re-registration.

continuing our high levels of service to you that have made our online banking
services such a phenomenal success.

"HSBC BANK

Good day, I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC
Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he
placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully
request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the
integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted
you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this
communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe
would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to
engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed
us that he had a financial portfolio of Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And
Fifty Thousand United States Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to
have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his
case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto
chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the
volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions
prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various
growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers
is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and
2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first
months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at
over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential
of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid
2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an
urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here
in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to
have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have
to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash
movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of
9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed
his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the
London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate
Securities Co is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net
worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or
undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and
highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was
deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the
money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This
was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th June 2003. In
June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that
the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as
far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking
sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities
Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim
his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately
passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of
HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our
client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a
heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify
the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an
investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation
and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private
banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity,
but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-
data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening
an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the
accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having
their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no
traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in
most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a
testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have
passed away, we instituted our own Investigations in good faith to determine
who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past
months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private
investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is
this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a
possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the
only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the
results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of
names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or
identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full
picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the
late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, Corporate Securities
Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements
of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably
revert the deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the
HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of
the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to
understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds
the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain
offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put
together the general direction of what I propose. I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to
do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is
concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the
funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the
file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has
no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward.
This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to
track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and have found no
family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar
details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in a position to
instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest
surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the
money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin
and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would
have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn
a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you
that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply
inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I
will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct
them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The
alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds
to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for
you to think of receiving the money from Cor! porate Securities Co. We can
fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of
this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you
should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive.
If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever
contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my
proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums
out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be
hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I
make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I
cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of
my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my
chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my
life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it
is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk
I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am
the only one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a
name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share
the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through
this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this
process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me
via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I
repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do
I wouldn�t you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me
only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email
address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines
are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of
customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe
this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a
wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to
what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing
gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.
This is the one truth I have learnt from my private banking clients. Do not
betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting,
soon. I await your response. Daniel Cole. N/B Kindly send your response to my
direct email address:cole833@katamail.com

"HSBC BANK

Good day, I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC
Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he
placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully
request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the
integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted
you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this
communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe
would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to
engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed
us that he had a financial portfolio of Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And
Fifty Thousand United States Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to
have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his
case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto
chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the
volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions
prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various
growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers
is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and
2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first
months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at
over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential
of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid
2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an
urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here
in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to
have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have
to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash
movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of
9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed
his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the
London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate
Securities Co is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net
worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or
undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and
highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well-connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was
deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the
money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This
was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th June 2003. In
June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that
the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as
far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking
sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities
Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim
his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately
passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of
HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our
client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a
heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify
the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an
investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation
and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private
banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity,
but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-
data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening
an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the
accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having
their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no
traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in
most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a
testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have
passed away, we instituted our own Investigations in good faith to determine
who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past
months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private
investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is
this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a
possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the
only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the
results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of
names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or
identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full
picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the
late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, Corporate Securities
Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements
of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably
revert the deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the
HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of
the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to
understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds
the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain
offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put
together the general direction of what I propose. I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to
do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is
concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the
funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the
file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has
no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward.
This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to
track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and have found no
family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar
details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in a position to
instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest
surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the
money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin
and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would
have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn
a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you
that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply
inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I
will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct
them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The
alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds
to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for
you to think of receiving the money from Corp orate Securities Co. We can
fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of
this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you
should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive.
If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever
contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my
proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums
out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be
hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I
make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I
cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of
my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my
chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my
life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it
is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk
I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am
the only one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a
name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share
the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through
this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this
process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me
via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I
repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do
I wouldn�t you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me
only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email
address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines
are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of
customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe
this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a
wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to
what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing
gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.
This is the one truth I have learnt from my private banking clients. Do not
betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting,
soon. I await your response. Daniel Cole. N/B Kindly send your response to my
direct email address:cole833@katamail.com

made. If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report

our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily
limited access to sensitive account features.

To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that
your account has not been compromised:

1\. Login to your **Chase Internet Banking** account. In case you are not
enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to use your Social Security
Number as both your Personal ID and Password.

2\. Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or
deposits, and check your account profile to make sure not changes have been
made. If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report
this to **Chase** staff immediately.

Dear **Chase** account holder,

We recently reviewed your account, and suspect that your **Chase Internet
Banking** account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party.
Protecting the security of your account and of the **Chase Bank** network is
our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily
limited access to sensitive account features.

To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that
your account has not been compromised:

1\. Login to your **Chase Internet Banking** account. In case you are not
enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to use your Social Security
Number as both your Personal ID and Password.

2\. Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or
deposits, and check your account profile to make sure not changes have been
made. If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report
this to **Chase** staff immediately.

Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue

Dear BB&T; Customer,  
  
We're pleased to announce that later this month your online account
information will be available through BB&T; OnlineSM. The site was recently
ranked #1 by Gomez®, an independent Internet rating service. It is easy to
navigate, with icons to guide you to many of our most frequently used
services. See for yourself by taking a test-drive:  To make the switch you
will need to re-enroll your account by clicking the above link as soon as
possible, as your business card accounts will no longer be available in our
old database.  
  
Please note the following changes to the payment posting policy on BB&T;
OnlineSM: Payments made prior to 4PM EST will be credited the same day.
Payments made after 4PM EST will be credited the next day at no charge. If it
is after 4PM and you need your payment to be credited the same day, you can do
so for a fee.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Thanks for choosing BB&T;,

our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily
limited access to sensitive account features.

To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that
your account has not been compromised:

1\. Login to your **Chase Internet Banking** account. In case you are not
enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to use your Social Security
Number as both your Personal ID and Password.

2\. Review your recent account history for any unauthorized withdrawals or
deposits, and check your account profile to make sure not changes have been
made. If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report
this to **Chase** staff immediately.

"Barclays security alert!

Good afternoon, dear client!  
  
More and more illegal operations took place with  
Barclays Bank accounts during last months. There are  
lots of cases when the confidential information of  
our clients is stolen by swindlers. Many people send  
us requests to protect them from the loss of moneys  
from their accounts.  
  
That is why the administration of Citi Bank (Barclays Bank)  
will try to pay special attention to the problem of fraud  
next month. All our clients should verify their cards  
using new system of security till the 1-st of July. We  
worked hard to improve the system of security. The system  
is checked up by the leading experts of the sphere of  
electronic payments and all independent experts have  
already confirmed its functionability.  
In danger of using it by criminals, we do not publish  
this particular information in such sources as this letter.  
  
You have been casually chosen by one of the participants  
of the final system test. At present we offer you to use  
your personal link
LINK[]  
to be registered in the system.  
  
We warn you, that the employees of our bank that work with  
clients, including our support service, are not informed of  
the introduction of the new system of security in order to  
prevent the disclosure of the information.  
  
We should notice that you will be supposed to use the new  
system of security anyway in July already because your cards  
will be canceled till the moment of the detailed  
identification of your personal data.  
Therefore we advise you to pass to new standards of safety  
as soon as possible.  
  
Your sincerely,  
Barclays Fraud and Security Department.

Dear **eBay** member,  
  
During our regularly schedule account maintenance and verification we have
detected a slight error in your billing information on file with eBay.

Your card will be used for identification only and will not be charged at any
time. By having this type of identification from all users, eBay remains a
safe place to buy and sell. Setting up a seller account necessitates valid
credit or debit card and checking account information.

For automatic payments, your credit card will normally be charged 5 to 7 days
after you receive your invoice. Enter and submit the required information.
Your account may be suspended for non-payment, and you may be responsible for
collection costs.

If you don't want to place your card on file, you can enter a different email
instead (only certain types of emails can be used, such as those issued by
companies, schools, and paid Internet Service providers).

accessed by terrorist organization attackers who try to obtain funds for their
criminal activities.

federal credit unions systems, this activity being asked by the _**United
States Government**_ .

**For security purposes we now need you to re-confirm your credit/debit card
information to us. If this is not completed in 48 hours, we will be forced to
suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent and
terrorist purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. **

**Summer's Top 7 Tips for Success on Your Journey  
**..................................................................................................

|   |

.................................................... ****

**Tip #1: Turn Lackluster CRM Into Stellar Customer Loyalty  
** American CEO's have reached a critical crossroads. They have invested
hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 3-5 years in comprehensive CRM
solutions. Now that these CRM systems are in place, they're asking, ""Where are
the results?"" How did this happen? As with many great concepts, CRM has been
implemented primarily by technology firms, and these firms have lost sight of
the goal: customer loyalty and retention.

**Tip #2: To Build Loyalty You Must First Build Trust  
** Based on extensive research into companies from start-ups to established
institutions, including Harley-Davidson, Intuit, Cisco, and Dell, six bedrock
ethical principles of loyalty emerge: (1) Never profit at the expense of
partners; (2) Be picky (3) Keep it simple; (4). Reward the right results; (5)
Listen hard, talk straight; and (6) Preach what you practice.

**Tip #3: Innovation Will Keep Customers Interested  
**Aeroplan, Canada's enormous consumer loyalty club, is a coalition of more
than 100 travel, retail and financial services brands. Millions of Canadians
are already members. But hardly any of them clicked through on Aeroplan's
member emails. Discover how Aeroplan's email design team ripped their welcome
messages and monthly newsletters apart, and then put them back together again
for increased results.

**Tip #4: Don't Forget Your Existing Customers  
**Every management authority says that loyal customers are the cornerstone of
long-term business growth. The reason is obvious: it is less costly to get
existing customers to buy more than it is to find new ones. True? For
incremental growth up to around 20% per year, the answer is yes. It's true.

**Tip #5: Adding E-Commerce Can Make All the Difference  
**On an average day, 10,000 visitors typically pay $20 each to tour the
Georgia Aquarium. That alone is a huge win for a tourist destination that only
opened last November. But here's an even bigger deal - 93% of tickets are sold
online, directly from the Aquarium's Web site. Discover how an innovative
approach to e-commerce can pay dividends.

**Tip #6: Success Requires More Than Just a Good Website  
**Many people are disillusioned with the ""build it and they'll come"" theory
where they invest significant resources in building a website only to see
lackluster results. Or worse yet, they're led to believe if they participate
in search-engine, or pay-per-click hocus-pocus that's all they'll ever need to
do. WRONG! Many end up wasting their time and hard earned money! The #1
marketing secret to online success is to combine offline marketing techniques
with your website.

**Tip #7: Above All, Keep Customers Happy  
**It's a well-known fact that it costs many times more to acquire a new
customer than to keep doing business with your existing ones. For this reason,
the best way to become profitable is to have loyal customers who keep coming
back again and again. It's all about relationship building.
