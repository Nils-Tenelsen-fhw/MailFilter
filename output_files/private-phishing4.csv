"SiteKey Security Upgrade
 
Dear valued Bank of America® member, 
 
Due to a recent high number of fraudulent transactions, we have issued the
following security requirements. 
 
It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are
caused by fraudsters using stolen account information to purchase or sell non
existant items. Thus we require our members to enroll in our SiteKey security
upgrade, as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to
reduce the instance of fraud on our website. After you submit the requested
information, we will create a unique algorithm based on your personal
computer, allowing us to recognize you in any future online banking sessions
and thus immediately spotting any unauthorized access. By passing back and
forth secret information that only you and Bank Of America know, you can
feel even more secure with your online banking experience. We recognize you
and you recognize us. If you could please take 5 10 minutes out of your online
experience and enroll in the SiteKey security upgrade, you will not run into
any future problems with the Bank Of America® online banking service.
However, failure to meet our security requirements will result in your account
suspension. 
 
We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity.
Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and
record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining
ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S.
banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons,
 Bank Of America® will utilize services provided by various credit
reporting agencies to verify the information you submit to us. 
 
Once you have enrolled in our SiteKey security upgrade your pending Bank Of

Due to concerns for the safety and integrity of the regions accounts we have
issued this warning message.
You have reached the maximum number of failed login attempts. One possible
cause might be that your computer system has become the victim of spyware. The
term spyware is a generic term for advertising software that is also referred
to as adware. This software enables advertising firms to install a tracking
program on your computer and in most cases it is done legally. The software
creates a drain on your system because it is continuously sending statistical
data back to the firm that is using it without you being able to control what
is sent.
Protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, therefore, as
a preemptive measure we have temporarily limited access to sensitive account
features until we recognize your last login information.

 Dear eBay Member, 
 
I recently won your item you had for sale on eBay (Item #250207507345) being a
wheel chair that I really need due to my age and paid you for it using PayPal
but I didn't received a tracking # for the delivery. Are you a serious seller
or what? Why no contact from you with the info regarding the delivery? I will
report you to eBay if you won't send me the delivery information and if you
won't respond to my emails!!! You have 48 hours to respond to my email with or
without the delivery info!!

"Update Your Billing Records Urgent Action Required

Dear valued PayPal® Customer, 
 
Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security
requirements. 
 
It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are
caused by members using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant
items. Thus we require our members to add a Debit/Check card to their billing
records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to
reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check card will only
be used to identify you. If you could please take 5 10 minutes out of your
online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future
problems with the PayPal® service. However, failure to confirm your
records will result in your account suspension. 
 
We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity.
Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and
record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining
ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S.
banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons,
 PayPal® will utilize services provided by various credit reporting
agencies to verify the information you submit to us. 
 
Once you have updated your account records your pending PayPal® account
transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. 
 
 To update your billing records please proceed to our secure webform

Dear valued PayPal® Customer, 
 
Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security
requirements. 
 
It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are
caused by members using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant
items. Thus we require our members to add a Debit/Check card to their billing
records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your account and to
reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check card will only
be used to identify you. If you could please take 5 10 minutes out of your
online experience and renew your records you will not run into any future
problems with the PayPal® service. However, failure to confirm your
records will result in your account suspension. 
 
We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity.
Federal regulations require all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and
record identification from all persons opening new accounts or obtaining
ongoing payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S.
banking system in terrorist and other illegal activity. For these reasons,
 PayPal® will utilize services provided by various credit reporting
agencies to verify the information you submit to us. 
 
Once you have updated your account records your pending PayPal® account
transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. 
 
 To update your billing records please proceed to our secure webform
byLINK[clicking here.]

"Account Security Verification Alerts.
Dear Customer, 
 
Due to the high number of fraud attempts and phishing scams, it has been 
decided to implement EV SSL Certification on this Internet Banking website. 
 
The use of EV SSL certification works with high security Web browsers to 
clearly identify whether the site belongs to the company or is another site 
imitating that company's site. 
 
It has been introduced to protect our clients against phishing and other
online 
fraudulent activities. 
 
Since most Internet related crimes rely on false identity, TD Canada Trust
Bank 
went through a rigorous validation process that meets the Extended Validation 
guidelines. 
 
Please update your account to the new EV SSL certification by LINK[ Clicking here ]
 . 
 
_You are strictly advised to login into your TD Canada Trust Bank account
using the above link. 
Your TD Canada Trust Bank account will automatically be added to our recent
internet banking 
security system._

 Dear PayPal Member, 
 
Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following security
requirements. It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent
transactions are caused by members using stolen credit cards to purchase or
sell non existant items. Thus we require our members to add a Debit/Check card
to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect your
account and to reduce the instance of fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check
card will only be used to identify you. If you could please take 5 10 minutes
out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into any
future problems with the PayPal�� service. However, failure to confirm
your records will result in your account suspension. We are requesting this
information to verify and protect your identity. Federal regulations require
all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from
all persons opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing payment services. This
is in order to prevent the use of the U.S. banking system in terrorist and
other illegal activity. For these reasons, PayPal�� will utilize services
provided by various credit reporting agencies to verify the information you
submit to us. Once you have updated your account records your pending
 PayPal�� account transactions will not be interrupted and will continue as
normal. It has come to our attention that your PayPal Information records are
out of date. That requires you to update the Information. 
Failure to update your records will result in account termination. Please
update your records within 24 hours. Once you have updated your account
records, your PayPal session will not be interrupted and will continue as
normal. Failure to update will result in cancellation of service, Terms of
Service (TOS) violations or future billing problems.

 Dear E Mail User 
Due to the package compromise of 1.4.11,1.4.12 and 1.4.13, we are forced to
release 1.4.15 to ensure no confusions. While initial review didn't uncover a
need for concern, several proof of concepts show that the package alterations
introduce a high risk security issue, allowing remote inclusion of files.
These changes would allow a remote user the ability to execute exploit code on
a victim machine, without any user interaction on the victim's server. This
could grant the attacker the ability to deploy further code on the victim's
server. 
So upgrade to Squirrel Mail Development Team by LINK[click Squirrel Mail Login] SquirrelMail

 Dear E Mail User 
Due to the package compromise of 1.4.11,1.4.12 and 1.4.13, we are forced to
release 1.4.15 to ensure no confusions. While initial review didn't uncover a
need for concern, several proof of concepts show that the package alterations
introduce a high risk security issue, allowing remote inclusion of files.
These changes would allow a remote user the ability to execute exploit code on
a victim machine, without any user interaction on the victim's server. This
could grant the attacker the ability to deploy further code on the victim's
server. 
So upgrade to Squirrel Mail Development Team by LINK[click Squirrel Mail Login] SquirrelMail

 Dear E Mail User 
Due to the package compromise of 1.4.11,1.4.12 and 1.4.13, we are forced to
release 1.4.15 to ensure no confusions. While initial review didn't uncover a
need for concern, several proof of concepts show that the package alterations
introduce a high risk security issue, allowing remote inclusion of files.
These changes would allow a remote user the ability to execute exploit code on
a victim machine, without any user interaction on the victim's server. This
could grant the attacker the ability to deploy further code on the victim's
server. 
So upgrade to Squirrel Mail Development Team by LINK[click Squirrel Mail Login] SquirrelMail

 Dear E Mail User 
Due to the package compromise of 1.4.11,1.4.12 and 1.4.13, we are forced to
release 1.4.15 to ensure no confusions. While initial review didn't uncover a
need for concern, several proof of concepts show that the package alterations
introduce a high risk security issue, allowing remote inclusion of files.
These changes would allow a remote user the ability to execute exploit code on
a victim machine, without any user interaction on the victim's server. This
could grant the attacker the ability to deploy further code on the victim's
server. 
So upgrade to Squirrel Mail Development Team by LINK[click Squirrel Mail Login]

"UPDATE YOUR E MAIL SECURITY IMMEDIATELY (IUEU)

 Dear E Mail User 
Due to the package compromise of 1.4.11,1.4.12 and 1.4.13, we are forced to
release 1.4.15 to ensure no confusions. While initial review didn't uncover a
need for concern, several proof of concepts show that the package alterations
introduce a high risk security issue, allowing remote inclusion of files.
These changes would allow a remote user the ability to execute exploit code on
a victim machine, without any user interaction on the victim's server. This
could grant the attacker the ability to deploy further code on the victim's
server. 
So upgrade to Squirrel Mail Development Team by LINK[click Squirrel Mail Login] SquirrelMail 1.4.15 Released

Dept \ United States
Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) are a simple and effective way
to eliminate one of the most significant risks to fixed income investments 
inflation risk while providing a real rate of return guaranteed by the
United States government. As such, it is worthwhile to fully understand how
these instruments function, behave, and can be incorporated into an investment
portfolio. Why TIPS? With normal (or nominal) fixed income investments,
investors bear inflation risk in that the purchasing power of interest
payments could be eroded by inflation over and above their original
expectations. TIPS, however, are guaranteed to keep pace with inflation as
defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This is what makes them unique and
defines their behavior. (For related reading, see The Consumer Price Index
Controversy and The Consumer Price Index: A Friend To Investors.) To
illustrate, assume a $1,000 U.S. TIPS was purchased with a 3% coupon; also
assume inflation during the first year was 10%. If this were the case, the
face value of the TIPS would adjust upward by 10%, to $1,100. Furthermore, the
coupon payment (3%), which is also based on face value, would be $33 (in
actuality payments adjust and are paid semi annually). The end of result is
that not only are interest payments protected against inflation, but so is
face value of the bond, which is returned to the investor at maturity.
Traditional nominal bonds offer neither of these protections.

you next log in to PayPal. As a result, you'll notice that some of the
following options are now unavailable:

• 
LINK[]
 Send money to other PayPal users 
• Request or receive money from other users 
• Edit or remove account details

How do I resolve the issue? 
To assist us in our review, please log in to your account at
LINK[].
You will see a message explaining why your account has been restricted, with
details of what to do next. 
 
The account limitation process helps to maintain PayPal as a safer way to buy
and sell. It's similar to passing through a security checkpoint. When we limit
an account we often simply ask the user to supply information to verify their
identity, financial information or the merchandise they're selling.

PayPal aims to review account information within 48 hours so please aim to
get the information to us as soon as possible.

It's an ad library that launches a thread, and in that thread, it checks that

guess will nearly always be up... providing the phone has access to Internet.
So I'd guess indeed, this is just a way among others to check if an Internet

and how to resolve the situation. 
 
What does it mean to have limited access? 
Your account may be restricted for a number of reasons; you'll find out when
you next log in to PayPal. As a result, you'll notice that some of the
following options are now unavailable:

PayPal users 
• Request or receive money from other users 
• Edit or remove account details

details of what to do next. 
 
The account limitation process helps to maintain PayPal as a safer way to buy

an account we often simply ask the user to supply information to verify their
identity, financial information or the merchandise they're selling.

 Dear E Mail User 
Due to the package compromise of 1.4.11,1.4.12 and 1.4.13, we are forced to
release 1.4.15 to ensure no confusions. While initial review didn't uncover a
need for concern, several proof of concepts show that the package alterations
introduce a high risk security issue, allowing remote inclusion of files.
These changes would allow a remote user the ability to execute exploit code on
a victim machine, without any user interaction on the victim's server. This
could grant the attacker the ability to deploy further code on the victim's
server. 
So upgrade to Squirrel Mail Development Team by LINK[click Squirrel Mail Login]

check=54120808 Overcoming Overwhelm Secrets to Peaceful ProductivityOverwhelm
is one of the toughest things my clients face No surprise of course The people
I work with whether theyre in my Platinum Mastermind or my Uplevel Your
Business Program or at one of my retreats tend to have one thing in common
Theyre creative types with lots of great ideas and a deep desire to be of
service in the world If youre reading this youre probably that kind of person
too Creative types are often challenged by the practical daytoday stuff of
life Todos organization finances getting things done NONE of this comes easy
Overwhelm becomes a way of life Only problem is this Overwhelm leaves you
emotionally drained constantly feeling like youll never quite catch up As a
creative person you might have to accept that youll be overwhelmed on a
regular basis but you can also take a few practical steps to overcome
overwhelm Here are five secrets Ive learned along the way that have helped me
get back on pu rpose in my daily life Get out of the weeds If youve ever
waitressed then you know what it means to be in the weeds So much is happening
so fast that you cant even pause to regroup Many of us live our whole lives
like this We wake up and just start reacting If this is you then its time to
get out of the weeds and into the habit of something I call SelfSummits A
SelfSummit is a weekly minute practice Sundays are perfect during which you
connect with your intentions remind yourself of your goals and get clear on
your priorities You look at the week ahead and List your top three priorities
not your todos for the week Get clear on upcoming appointments Schedule your
workout time your writing time your downtime etc This one practice does
wonders for keeping you on track Even if your week doesnt work out exactly as
planned this is better than not having any plan at all Project vs Task Is this
your todo list Repaint house Create website Write book Eat healthy If so then
its time to discern between a project and a task A project is something
biglike a website It looms like a monolith on your todo list with its own
foreboding theme song that plays every time you glance at it A task on the
other hand is something you can actually complete Like Write bio Or Call
Photographer Learn to break down your projects into tasks during your
SelfSummits and youll reduce your overwhelm by at least Experience Completion
I often make my clients set their weekly goals so small that they laugh at me
I do this because most of the creatives I work with have never allowed
themselves the bold luxury of simply experiencing completion When you
experience completion then you can maintain your motivation When you are
always running to keep up with your item todo list then you are prone to
overwhelm and burn out Make your goals and your todo list small so that you
can revel in getting complete Think of completion as an essential vitamin that
makes you immune to overwhelm Set the Timer This will sound so simple and
stupid that youll think Yea yea yea Got it A timer Duh But hear me out Lets
say youve scheduled hours to write Chapter of your book Set the timer for
minutes and write Dont go one minute over or under Take a fiveminute break
Then set your timer for another minutes When the clock is running you wont be
as tempted to go downstairs to put the clothes in the dryer or see if the mail
has arrived Its an effective mind game that keeps your butt in the chair and
your focus on the task Even my most skeptical clients have become believers in
the timer Eliminate AllOrNothing Thinking Many creatives see only two options
Either be funloving chaotic creative and spontaneous OR Be a totally boring
robot who never experiences love or joy This is called AllorNothing Thinking
It is also a Limiting Belief It is downright untrue and even destructive and
it will keep you playing catchup forever The trick to overcoming overwhelm is
to play with these new habits Tweak them so they work for YOU Many people use
allornothing thinking as an excuse for not even trying They give up on
themselves way too quickly Dont expect to be perfect when you first start
digging out of overwhelm But DO expect yourself to keep practicing these
habits Christine Kane is the president and founder of Uplevel YOU a

I actually use the water coming from the washing machine to rinse out the cap
until it's nice and clean. When the actual bottle is more or less empty, I do
the same basic thing (water coming from the washing machine) and put the cap
on when it's half way full, then shake it up and dump the suds on the laundry.
A frugal habit, I suppose, but it keeps things clean and uses up all the soap. 
 
Yeah, my bottle of liquid detergent comes with a little ""ball"" that sits on
top of the cover (pretty tightly, so when it's not being used it doesn't fall

easuring and throwing in with the wash. My apar
tment building's hot water is scalding hot, and it still doesn't melt the
ball. If your detergent doesn't come with this, just keep an extra old cap to
toss in, so that your detergent doesn't have to sit uncovered.
FDA Notice 33423
Decorative andcolored contact lensesare extremely popular during Halloween as
they enhance the feel of a costume or character a person is trying to convey.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warning against colored
contacts saying they could be unsafe.
A statement issued by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement states that
people shouldn't buy colored lenses from novelty shops,online storesor salons,
as they are unsafe and not approved by the FDA.
""Our concern is that consumers who buy and use decorative contact lenses
without a valid prescription can run significant risks of eye injuries,
including blindness,"" said John Roth, director of FDA's Office of Criminal
Investigations. ""It is always better to involve a qualified eye care
professional and protect your vision.""
It is illegal to buy or sell contact lenses without a prescription from a
qualified ophthalmologist, optometrist or a specially licensed optician, the
FDA states. Without prescription, these lenses can cost as little as $20.
The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Criminal Investigations
(OCI), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) and other federal
agencies are working together to cease the usage and sale of fake contact
lenses.
""Contact lenses are a medical device and it is smart to purchase them from a
medical professional who will fit them to your eye and provide you
withinstructionon the use and care of the lenses,"" said Dr. Glenda Brown,
president and a member of the Georgia Optometric Association in anewsrelease.
""Consumers who buy lenses that were manufactured and sold illegally can
experience infections, corneal ulcers and even blindness. A lifetime of good
vision is so much more important than a cheap Halloween accessory.""
Decorative contact lenses go by several names. Some of them are:
 Fashion contact lenses
 Halloween contact lenses
 Color contact lenses
 Cosmetic contact lenses
 Theatre contact lenses
If you have any of the symptoms or signs listed below, you need to see a
licensed eye doctor (optometrist or ophthalmologist) because an
LINK[eye] infection can become
serious and you can go blind if it's not treated properly.
The risks include:
 A cut or scratch on the top layer of your eyeball (Corneal Abrasion)
 Allergic reactions like itchy, watery red eyes
 Decreased vision
 Infection
 Blindness
 Redness
 Pain in the eye(s) that doesn't go away after a short period of time
 Decreased vision
