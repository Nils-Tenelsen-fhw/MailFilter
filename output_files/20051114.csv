some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud  
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.

require some specific information from you for the following reason:

features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please  
understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.  
  
Case ID Number: PP-040-187-541

time, it may result in further limitations on the use of your account.`

|   |  | About NCUA  
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal
agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions. NCUA, backed of the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit
Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insuring the savings of 80 million account
holders in all federal credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions.

During the 1990s and into the 21st century, credit unions have been healthy
and growing. Credit union failures remain low and the Share Insurance Fund
maintains a healthy equity level.  
  
---  
  

  
The **National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)** is comitted to maintain a
safe environment for over 80 million account holders in all federal credit
unions and many state-chartered credit unions. Protecting the security of
holders account and of the **Federal Credit Unions (FCU)** network is our
primary concern. To protect the security of your account, **NCUA** employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud
teams regularly scan the federal credit unions systems for unusual activity.

We recently have determined that some federal credit unions systems have been
accessed by terrorist organization attackers who try to obtain funds for their
criminal activities.

Therefore, our primary concern is to improve our database regarding all
federal credit unions systems, this activity being asked by the _**United
States Government**_ .  
  

**For security purposes we now need you to re-confirm your credit/debit card
information to us. If this is not completed in 48 hours, we will be forced to
suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent and
terrorist purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. **

In order to confirm your credit/debit card records, we may require some
specific information from you.

Dear Credit Union 1 Member,

At Credit Union 1 , the highest responsability to our customer is the
safekeeping of confidential information you have entrusted to us and using it
in a responsable manner. A fundamental element of safeguarding your
confidential information is to provide protection against unauthorized access
or use of this information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural
safeguards that comply with federal guidelines to guard your nonpublic
personal information against unauthorized access. Our mission is to reduce the
instance of fraud.

As a public service, our bank enables any individual, anywhere in the world,
to check your credit card to see whether or not your card, and possibly your
identity, have become compromised.

A frequent question we get is ""where do you get compromised credit cards and

Universities, marketing lists, and potentially anywhere you've ever paid for
anything with a check or credit card (online & offline). Additionally, bits of
your financial information are generated every day, in the form of: your name
and address from piece of junk mail, a restaurant receipt with your credit
card number, ATM receipts, credit card bills, bank statements.

At this time we need you to confirm your identity with our existing database
and prevent fraudulent use of your financial information. As soon as our
database will be confirmed we need to make some important anouncements to our
customers so please confirm your identity with no delay. Please click on the

request: Please follow the Member Verification Procedure (Second Notice)  
---  
  
Dear eBay Member,  
  
Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing
a new account verification method. From time to time, randomly selected
accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced verification
process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations and customers credit
card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or
more photo ID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit
card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit card number,
billing address etc. without letting us know about the change.  
Subject of this verification process are also the accounts that have unpaid
dues to eBay.  
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this
message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your
eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized
account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay policy to
represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation
of local, national, and/or international law. eBay is committed to assist law
enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal
information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be
provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that
perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

**Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might be
because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that the
account was not updated at all.**

"Your Amazon.com Inquiry

Thank you for writing to Amazon.com to bring this to our attention. The
message you received was not sent to you by Amazon.com. We are investigating
the situation and working to get that webpage removed. You did the right thing
by contacting us. For your protection, we suggest that you never respond to
requests for personal information that may be contained in the forged e- mail.
I've provided some tips below my signature to help you identify spoof
messages. I want to assure you that Amazon.com is not in the business of
selling customer information. Many spammers and spoofers use programs that
randomly generate e-mail addresses, in the hope that some percentage of these
randomly-generated addresses will actually exist. Important Note: If you
submitted your credit card number to the faked ""Amazon.com"" web site, we
advise that you take steps to protect your information by notifying your
credit card company. Additionally, you should delete that credit card from
your Amazon.com account to prevent anyone from improperly regaining access to
your account. To do so, click the link in your Seller Account to ""Change your
Amazon.com store-wide settings such as e- mail, address book, and 1-Click.""
Then click ""Edit or delete a credit card"" under Payment Settings in Your
Account. Amazon.com has recently taken steps to combat e-mail forgeries such
as this in the U.S. and Canada; you can read more about our efforts here:
https://its.phishing.fake I have included more information below my
signature to assist you in identifying e-mail forgeries. If you encounter any
other spoof messages in the future, please forward the messages to stop-
spoofing@amazon.com. Thank you again for taking the time to contact us. Best
regards, Amie M. Amazon.com Customer Service https://its.phishing.fake Check your order and more:
https://its.phishing.fake 1\. Amazon.com will *not* ask you for the
following information in an e-mail message: * Your Amazon.com password * Your
bank account information * Your credit card information or PIN * Your social
security number * Your mother's maiden name or other information to identify
you 2\. Be on the lookout for poor grammar or typographical errors. Many
phishing e-mails are translated from other languages or are sent without being
proof-read. As a result, these messages can contain bad grammar or
typographical errors. 3\. Check the return address-- genuine e-mails come from
an e-mail address ending in ""@amazon.com"". 4\. Check the Web site address--
genuine Amazon.com Web sites always end with "".amazon.com"" -- that is,
