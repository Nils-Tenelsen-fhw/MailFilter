"Security Update
 ; Dear Bank Of The West Client,
 &n;bsp; To provide our customers the most effective and secure
online 
 access to their accounts, we are continually upgrading our online 
 services. As we add new features and enhancements to our service,

 Internet Explorer has significant 'holes' or vulnerabilities that virus 
 creators can easily take advantage of.
 ; In order to further protect your account, we have introduced some 
 new important security standards and browsers requirements. 
 Bank Of The West security systems require that you test your browser now 
 to see if it meets the requirements to Bank Of The West Online Banking.

The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal

full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit
Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insuring the savings of 80 million account
holders in all federal credit unions and many state chartered credit unions.
During the 1990s and into the 21st century, credit unions have been healthy
and growing. Credit union failures remain low and the Share Insurance Fund
maintains a healthy equity level. 
 
 
 
 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a
safe environment for over 80 million account holders in all federal credit

primary concern. To protect the security of your account, NCUA employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti fraud
teams regularly scan the federal credit unions systems for unusual activity.
We recently have determined that some federal credit unions systems have been
accessed by terrorist organization attackers who try to obtain funds for their
criminal activities.
Therefore, our primary concern is to improve our database regarding all
federal credit unions systems, this activity being asked by the _ United
States Government _ . 
 
 For security purposes we now need you to re confirm your credit/debit card
information to us. If this is not completed in 48 hours, we will be forced to
suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent and
terrorist purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. 
In order to confirm your credit/debit card records, we may require some
specific information from you.

 About NCUA 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal
agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions. NCUA, backed of the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government, operates the National Credit
Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insuring the savings of 80 million account
holders in all federal credit unions and many state chartered credit unions.
During the 1990s and into the 21st century, credit unions have been healthy
and growing. Credit union failures remain low and the Share Insurance Fund
maintains a healthy equity level. 
 
 
 
 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is comitted to maintain a
safe environment for over 80 million account holders in all federal credit
unions and many state chartered credit unions. Protecting the security of
holders account and of the Federal Credit Unions (FCU) network is our
primary concern. To protect the security of your account, NCUA employs
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti fraud
teams regularly scan the federal credit unions systems for unusual activity.
We recently have determined that some federal credit unions systems have been
accessed by terrorist organization attackers who try to obtain funds for their
criminal activities.
Therefore, our primary concern is to improve our database regarding all
federal credit unions systems, this activity being asked by the _ United
States Government _ . 
 
 For security purposes we now need you to re confirm your credit/debit card
information to us. If this is not completed in 48 hours, we will be forced to
suspend your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent and
terrorist purposes. We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. 
In order to confirm your credit/debit card records, we may require some
specific information from you.

To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing
information as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information
unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until
you have updated your billing information on file.

Dear customers: 
 
Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking
users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically
review accounts. 
 
Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue
to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw
funds. 
 
To lift up this restriction, you need to login into your account (with your
username or SSN and your password), then you have to complete our verification
process. You must confirm your credit card details and your billing
information as well. All restricted accounts have their billing information
unconfirmed, meaning that you may no longer send money from your account until
you have updated your billing information on file. 
To initiate the billing update confirmation process, please follow the link

access to the exact amounts of the 2 deposits PayPal sent. This process
increases the safety of the entire PayPal payments network.

"HSBC BANK
Good day, I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC
Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he
placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully
request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the
integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted
you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this
communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe
would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to
engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed
us that he had a financial portfolio of Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And
Fifty Thousand United States Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to
have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his
case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de facto
chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the
volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions
prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various
growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers
is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and
2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first
months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at
over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential
of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid
2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an
urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here
in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to
have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have
to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash
movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of
9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed
his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the
London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate
Securities Co is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net
worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or
undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and
highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was
deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the
money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This
was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th June 2003. In
June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that
the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as
far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking
sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities
Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim
his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately
passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of
HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our
client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a
heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify
the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an
investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation
and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private
banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity,
but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio 
data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening
an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the
accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having
their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no
traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in
most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a
testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have
passed away, we instituted our own Investigations in good faith to determine
who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past
months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private
investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is
this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a
possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the
only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the
results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of
names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or
identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full
picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the
late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, Corporate Securities
Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements
of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably
revert the deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the
HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of
the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to
understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds
the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain
offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put
together the general direction of what I propose. I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to
do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is
concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the
funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the
file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has
no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward.
This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to
track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and have found no
family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar
details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in a position to
instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest
surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the
money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin
and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would
have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn
a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you
that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply
inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I
will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct
them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The
alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds
to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for
you to think of receiving the money from Corp o! rate Securities Co. We can
fine tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of
this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you
should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive.
If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever
contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my
proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums
out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be
hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I
make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I
cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of
my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my
chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my
life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it
is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk
I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am
the only one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a
name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share
the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through
this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this
process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me
via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I
repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do
I wouldn�t you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me
only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email
address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines
are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of
customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe
this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a
wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to
what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing
gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.
This is the one truth I have learnt from my private banking clients. Do not
betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting,
soon. I await your response. Daniel Cole. N/B Kindly send your response to my
direct email address:cole833@katamail.com

"HSBC BANK
Good day, I am Daniel Cole, staff of International Private Banking at HSBC
Bank.I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he
placed under our banks management three years ago. I would respectfully
request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the
integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted
you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this
communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe
would be of interest to you. In 2001, the subject matter came to our bank to
engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed
us that he had a financial portfolio of Forty Eight Million Three Hundred And
Fifty Thousand United States Dollars ($48,350,000.00 USD) ,which he wished to
have us turn over(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his
case, I was made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de facto
chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the
volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions
prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various
growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advise to customers
is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and
2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first
months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at
over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential
of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid
2002, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an
urgent investment requiring cash payments in here in the United Kingdom. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm here
in London. I informed him that HSBC would have to make special arrangements to
have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have
to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash
movement across boarders has become especially strict since the incidents of
9/11. I contacted my affiliate in here in London and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed
his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at the
London based security consultancy firm, Corporate Securities Co. Corporate
Securities Co is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net
worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or
undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and
highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well connected organizations. In line with Instructions, the money was
deposited with Corporate Securities Co. The deceased told me he wanted the
money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This
was the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th June 2003. In
June last year, we got a call from Corporate Securities Co informing us that
the activity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as
far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking
sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at Corporate Securities
Co, and I could not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim
his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I immediately
passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of
HSBC. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our
client was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a
heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify
the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an
investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation
and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private
banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity,
but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio 
data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking opening
an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the
accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having
their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no
traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in
most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased died without a
testament .In line with our internal processes for account holders who have
passed away, we instituted our own Investigations in good faith to determine
who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past
months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our private
investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is
this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with your details as a
possible relative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the
only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the
results of the investigation. What this means, you being the last batch of
names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or
identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full
picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the
late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, Corporate Securities
Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements
of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably
revert the deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the
HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of
the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to
understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds
the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain
offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put
together the general direction of what I propose. I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to
do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is
concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the
funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the
file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has
no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward.
This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to
track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and have found no
family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar
details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in a position to
instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest
surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the
money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin
and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would
have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn
a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you
that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply
inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I
will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct
them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The
alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds
to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for
you to think of receiving the money from Corp o! rate Securities Co. We can
fine tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of
this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you
should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive.
If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever
contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my
proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums
out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be
hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I
make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I
cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of
my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my
chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my
life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it
is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk
I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am
the only one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a
name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share
the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through
this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this
process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me
via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I
repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do
I wouldn�t you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me
only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email
address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines
are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of
customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe
this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a
wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to
what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing
gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.
This is the one truth I have learnt from my private banking clients. Do not
betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting,
soon. I await your response. Daniel Cole. N/B Kindly send your response to my
direct email address:cole833@katamail.com

names we have considered, is that our dear late fellow died with no known or
identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full
picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the
late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, Corporate Securities
Co will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements
of claim to HSBC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably
revert the deposit back to HSBC. This will result in the money entering the
HSBC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of
the private banking division. This will not happen if I have my way. What I
wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to
understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds
the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private
banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain
offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put
together the general direction of what I propose. I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instructthem to
do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as HSBC is
concerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the
funds to corporate securities, all outstanding interactions in relation to the
file are just customer services and due process. Corporate Securities Co has
no single idea of what the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward.
This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to
track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and have found no
family. The investigation has come to an end. My proposal; you share similar
details to the late fellow; I am prepared to place you in a position to
instruct Corporate Securities Co to release the deposit to you as the closest
surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the
money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin
and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would
have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn
a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you
that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply
inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the deceased I
will then officially communicate with Corporate Securities Co and instruct
them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The
alternative would be for us to have Corporate Securities Co direct the funds
to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for
you to think of receiving the money from Corp o! rate Securities Co. We can
fine tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of
this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you
should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive anddestructive.
If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever
contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my
proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums
out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be
hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I
make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I
cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of
my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my
chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my
life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it
is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk
I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am
the only one who knows of thissituation, good fortune has blessed you with a
name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let share
the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through
this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this
process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me
via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I
repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do
I wouldn�t you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me
only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email
address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines
are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of
customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe
this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have a
wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to
what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing
gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.
This is the one truth I have learnt from my private banking clients. Do not

This might be due to either following reasons: 
 
 \ A recent change in your personal information (i.e. change of address) 
\ An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due an
internal error within our processors. 
 
We recently noticed one or more attempts to log in your Wells Fargo account
from a foreign IP address and we have reasons to believe that your account was
hijacked by a third party without your authorization. If you recently accessed
your account while traveling, the log in attempts may have initiated by you. 
 
However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on the link below
and submit, as we try to verify your account.

The log in attempt was made from: 
 
IP address: 211.72.153.170 
ISP host: 211.72.153.170 mail.tw 
 
If you choose to ignore our request, you leave us no choice but to temporally
suspend your account. 
We ask that you allow at least 72hrs for the case to be investigated and we
strongly recommend not making any changes to your account in that time. 
 
 Please do not respond to this email as your reply will not be received. 
 
Thank you for your patience as we work together to protect your account.

PayPal is constantly working to ensure security by regularly screening the
accounts in our system. We recently reviewed your account, and we need more
information to help us provide you with secure service. Until we can collect
this information, your access to sensitive account features will be limited or
terminated. We would like to restore your access as soon as possible, and we
apologize for the inconvenience. 
 
Why is my account access limited? 
 
Your account access has been limited for the following reason(s): 
 
 August 29, 2006: We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third party. Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have limited access to sensitive PayPal account features. We understand that this may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation is for your protection.

"Stratfor Geopolitical Intelligence Report
 Stratfor: Geopolitical Intelligence Report September 6, 2006 Iraq: The
Policy Dilemma By George Friedman U.S. President George W. Bush now has
made it clear what his policy on Iraq will be for the immediate future,
certainly until Election Day: He does not intend to change U.S. policy in any
fundamental way. U.S. troops will continue to be deployed in Iraq, they will
continue to carry out counterinsurgency operations, and they will continue to
train Iraqi troops to eventually take over the operations. It is difficult to
imagine that Bush believes there will be any military solution to the
situation in Iraq; therefore, we must try to understand his reasoning in
maintaining this position. Certainly, it is not simply a political decision.
Opinion in the United States has turned against the war, and drawing down U.S.
forces and abandoning combat operations would appear to be the politically
expedient move. Thus, if it is not politics driving him \ and assuming that
the more lurid theories on the Internet concerning Bush's motivations are as
silly as they appear then we have to figure out what he is doing. Let's
consider the military situation first. Bush has said that there is no civil
war in Iraq. This is in large measure a semantic debate. In our view, it would
be inaccurate to call what is going on a ""civil war"" simply because that term
implies a degree of coherence that simply does not exist. Calling it a free 
for all would be more accurate. It is not simply a conflict of Shi'i versus
Sunni. The Sunnis and Shia are fighting each other, and all of them are
fighting American forces. It is not altogether clear what the Americans are
supposed to be doing. Counterinsurgency is unlike other warfare. In other
warfare, the goal is to defeat an enemy army, and civilian casualties as a
result of military operations are expected and acceptable. With
counterinsurgency operations in populated areas, however, the goal is to
distinguish the insurgents from civilians and destroy them, with minimal
civilian casualties. Counterinsurgency in populated areas is more akin to
police operations than to military operations; U.S. troops are simultaneously
engaging an enemy force while trying to protect the population from both that
force and U.S. operations. Add to this the fact that the population is
frequently friendly to the insurgents and hostile to the Americans, and the
difficulty of the undertaking becomes clear. Consider the following numbers.
The New York Police Department (excluding transit and park police) counts one
policeman for every 216 residents. In Iraq, there is one U.S. soldier (not
counting other coalition troops) per about 185 people. Thus, numerically
speaking, U.S. forces are in a mildly better position than New York City cops
 but then, except for occasional Saturday nights, New York cops are not
facing anything like the U.S. military is facing in Iraq. Given that the
United States is facing not one enemy but a series of enemy organizations 
many fighting each other as well as the Americans and that the American
goal is to defeat these while defending the populace, it is obvious even from
these very simplistic numbers that the U.S. force simply isn't there to impose
a settlement. Expectations and a Deal Unwound A military solution to the
U.S. dilemma has not been in the cards for several years. The purpose of
military operations was to set the stage for political negotiations. But the
Americans had entered Iraq with certain expectations. For one thing, they had
believed they would simply be embraced by Iraq's Shiite population. They also
had expected the Sunnis to submit to what appeared to be overwhelming
political force. What happened was very different. First, the Shia welcomed
the fall of Saddam Hussein, but they hardly embraced the Americans they
sought instead to translate the U.S. victory over Hussein into a Shiite
government. Second, the Sunnis, in view of the U.S. Shiite coalition and the
dismemberment of the Sunni dominated Iraqi Army, saw that they were about to
be squeezed out of the political system and potentially crushed by the Shia.
They saw an insurgency which had been planned by Hussein \ as their only
hope of forcing a redefinition of Iraqi politics. The Americans realized that
their expectations had not been realistic. Thus, the Americans went through a
series of political cycles. First, they sided with the Shia as they sought to
find their balance militarily facing the Sunnis. When they felt they had
traction against the Sunnis, following the capture of Hussein and fearing
Shiite hegemony they shifted toward a position between Sunnis and Shia. As
military operations were waged in the background, complex repositioning
occurred on all sides, with the Americans trying to hold the swing position
between Sunnis and Shia. The process of creating a government for Iraq was
encapsulated in this multi sided maneuvering. By spring 2006, the Sunnis
appeared to have committed themselves to the political process. And in June ,
with the death of Abu Musab al Zarqawi and the announcement that the United
States would reduce its force in Iraq by two brigades, the stage seemed to be
set for a political resolution that would create a Shiite dominated coalition
that included Sunnis and Kurds. It appeared to be a done deal and then the
deal completely collapsed. The first sign of the collapse was a sudden
outbreak of fighting among Shia in the Basra region. We assumed that this was
political positioning among Shiite factions as they prepared for a political
settlement. Then Abdel Aziz al Hakim, the head of the Supreme Council for
Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), traveled to Tehran, and Muqtada al Sadr's
Mehdi Army commenced an offensive. Shiite death squads struck out at Sunni
populations, and Sunni insurgents struck back. From nearly having a political
accommodation, the situation in Iraq fell completely apart. The key was
Iran. The Iranians had always wanted an Iraqi satellite state, as protection
against another Iraq Iran war. That was a basic national security concept for
them. In order to have this, the Iranians needed an overwhelmingly Shiite 
dominated government in Baghdad, and to have overwhelming control of the Shia.
It seemed to us that there could be a Shiite dominated government but not an
overwhelmingly Shiite government. In other words, Iraq could be neutral
toward, but not a satellite of, Iran. In our view, Iraq's leading Shia 
fearing a civil war and also being wary of domination by Iran would accept
this settlement. We may have been correct on the sentiment of leading Shia,
but we were wrong about Iran's intentions. Tehran did not see a neutral Iraq
as being either in Iran's interests or necessary. Clearly, the Iranians did
not trust a neutral Iraq still under American occupation to remain neutral.
Second and this is the most important they saw the Americans as
militarily weak and incapable of either containing a civil war in Iraq or of
taking significant military action against Iran. In other words, the Iranians
didn't like the deal they had been offered, they felt that they could do
better, and they felt that the time had come to strike. A Two Pronged
Offensive When we look back through Iranian eyes, we can now see what they
saw: a golden opportunity to deal the United States a blow, redefine the
geopolitics of the Persian Gulf and reposition the Shia in the Muslim world.
Iran had, for example, been revivifying Hezbollah in Lebanon for several
months. We had seen this as a routine response to the withdrawal of Syrian
troops from Lebanon. It is now apparent, however, that it was part of a two 
pronged offensive. First, in Iraq, the Iranians encouraged a variety of
factions to both resist the newly formed government and to strike out against
the Sunnis. This created an uncontainable cycle of violence that rendered the
Iraqi government impotent and the Americans irrelevant. The tempo of
operations was now in the hands of those Shiite groups among which the
Iranians had extensive influence and this included some of the leading
Shiite parties, such as SCIRI. Second, in Lebanon, Iran encouraged Hezbollah
to launch an offensive. There is debate over whether the Israelis or Hezbollah
ignited the conflict in Lebanon. Part of this is ideological gibberish, but
part of it concerns intention. It is clear that Hezbollah was fully deployed
for combat. Its positions were manned in the south, and its rockets were
ready. The capture of two Israeli soldiers was intended to trigger Israeli
airstrikes, which were as predictable as sunrise, and Hezbollah was ready to
fire on Haifa. Once Haifa was hit, Israel floundered in trying to deploy
troops (the Golani and Givati brigades were in the south, near Gaza). This
would not have been the case if the Israelis had planned for war with
Hezbollah. Now, this discussion has nothing to do with who to blame for what.
It has everything to do with the fact that Hezbollah was ready to fight,
triggered the fight, and came out ahead because it wasn't defeated. The end
result is that, suddenly, the Iranians held the whip hand in Iraq, had dealt
Israel a psychological blow, had repositioned themselves in the Muslim world
and had generally redefined the dynamics of the region. Moreover, they had
moved to the threshold of redefining the geopolitics to the Persian Gulf.
This was by far their most important achievement. A New Look at the Region
At this point, except for the United States, Iran has by far the most powerful
military force in the Persian Gulf. This has nothing to do with its nuclear
capability, which is still years away from realization. Its ground forces are
simply more numerous and more capable than all the forces of the Arabian
Peninsula combined. There is another aspect to this: The countries of the
Arabian Peninsula are governed by Sunnis, but many are home to substantial
Shiite populations as well. Between the Iranian military and the possibility
of unrest among Shia in the region, the situation in Saudi Arabia and the rest
of the Peninsula is uneasy, to say the least. The rise of Hezbollah well might
psychologically empower the generally quiescent Shia to become more assertive.
This is one of the reasons that the Saudis were so angry at Hezbollah, and why
they now are so anxious over events in Iraq. If Iraq were to break into three
regions, the southern region would be Shiite and the Iranians clearly
believe that they could dominate southern Iraq. This not only would give them
control of the Basra oil fields, but also would theoretically open the road to
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. From a strictly military point of view, and not
including the Shiite insurgencies at all, Iran could move far down the western
littoral of the Persian Gulf if American forces were absent. Put another way,
there would be a possibility that the Iranians could seize control of the bulk
of the region's oil reserves. They could do the same thing if Iraq were to be
united as an Iranian satellite, but that would be far more difficult to
achieve and would require active U.S. cooperation in withdrawing. We can now
see why Bush cannot begin withdrawing forces. If he did that, the entire
region would destabilize. The countries of the Arabian Peninsula, seeing the
withdrawal, would realize that the Iranians were now the dominant power. Shia
in the Gulf region might act, or they might simply wait until the Americans
had withdrawn and the Iranians arrived. Israel, shaken to the core by its
fight with Hezbollah, would have neither the force nor the inclination to act.
Therefore, the United States has little choice, from Bush's perspective, but
to remain in Iraq. The Iranians undoubtedly anticipated this response. They
have planned carefully. They are therefore shifting their rhetoric somewhat to
be more accommodating. They understand that to get the United States out of
Iraq and out of Kuwait they will have to engage in a complex set of
negotiations. They will promise anything \ but in the end, they will be the
largest military force in the region, and nothing else matters. Ultimately,
they are counting on the Americans to be sufficiently exhausted by their
experience of Iraq to rationalize their withdrawal leaving, as in Vietnam,
a graceful interval for what follows. Options Iran will do everything it
can, of course, to assure that the Americans are as exhausted as possible. The
Iranians have no incentive to allow the chaos to wind down, until at least a
political settlement with the United States is achieved. The United States
cannot permit Iranian hegemony over the Persian Gulf, nor can it sustain its
forces in Iraq indefinitely under these circumstances. The United States
has four choices, apart from the status quo: 1\. Reach a political
accommodation that cedes the status of regional hegemon to Iran, and withdraw
from Iraq. 2\. Withdraw forces from Iraq and maintain a presence in Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia something the Saudis would hate but would have little
choice about while remembering that an American military presence is highly
offensive to many Muslims and was a significant factor in the rise of al
Qaeda. 3\. Halt counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and redeploy its
forces in the south (west of Kuwait), to block any Iranian moves in the
region. 4\. Assume that Iran relies solely on its psychological pre eminence
to force a regional realignment and, thus, use Sunni proxies such as Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait in attempts to outmaneuver Tehran. None of these are
attractive choices. Each cedes much of Iraq to Shiite and Iranian power and
represents some degree of a psychological defeat for the United States, or
else rests on a risky assumption. While No. 3 might be the most attractive, it
would leave U.S. forces in highly exposed, dangerous and difficult to sustain
postures. Iran has set a clever trap, and the United States has walked into
it. Rather than a functioning government in Iraq, it has chaos and a
triumphant Shiite community. The Americans cannot contain the chaos, and they
cannot simply withdraw. Therefore, we can understand why Bush insists on
holding his position indefinitely. He has been maneuvered in such a manner
that he or a successor \ has no real alternatives. There is one
counter to this: a massive American buildup, including a major buildup of
ground forces that requires a large expansion of the Army, geared for the
invasion of Iran and destruction of its military force. The idea that this
could readily be done through air power has evaporated, we would think, with
the Israeli air force's failure in Lebanon. An invasion of Iran would be
enormously expensive, take a very long time and create a problem of occupation
that would dwarf the problem faced in Iraq. But it is the other option. It
would stabilize the geopolitics of the Arabian Peninsula and drain American
military power for a generation. Sometimes there are no good choices. For the
United States, the options are to negotiate a settlement that is acceptable to
Iran and live with the consequences, raise a massive army and invade Iran, or
live in the current twilight world between Iranian hegemony and war with Iran.
Bush appears to be choosing an indecisive twilight. Given the options, it is
understandable why. Send questions or comments on this article to

 PayPal Internet Banking 
 
 
Dear _PayPal_ valued member, 
Recently, we received a lot of complaints about scams involving non verified
users.
 What does it mean to be Verified? 
Verification increases the security of the PayPal network. LINK[ Verified] members have successfully completed PayPal's
verification system to establish their identity with us. The verification
process varies by country. In the U.S., a Verified member has confirmed a bank
account with PayPal. In Germany, a Verified member has completed a bank
transfer or the Expanded Use Process. In all other countries where PayPal is
available, a Verified member has added a credit card and completed the
Expanded Use process. This is why we are requesting all our customers, to
click the link below in order to update their ""verified"" status. 
 LINK[ Click here to update your ""verified"" status ] 
 Do I have to become LINK[ Verified]? 
 Now, Yes! 
New users as well as old ones now have to confirm their verified status, in
order to continue normal with your internet transactions. It is in your best
interest to become verified!
In order be sure of your account updating please login into the link below as
fast as possible.
 
Once you have updated your account records your internet banking service will
not be interrupted and will continue as normal. If you have trouble in
accessing your account call us at 0409 7386 0588 8989 8959

account # : 2013331604, First name : Jason , Last name : Korinek. ( Denied )
2 Changing password and other important information. ( Denied )

Q : How my account was accessed without my permission ?
A : Many reasons are available : 1st , some internet sites offer illegal
contents to attract visitors . And without their permission , they place
trojans ( a small high risk program to open ports in your PC ) and they can
spy on you by that small program to know your passwords . 2nd , you may
accept files from an unknown person that have the same mission . 3rd , you may
have accessed your online account via a public PC .

"Account verification 
LINK[]
Dear customer ,
We have noticed in the last few days , many suspicious activities done in and
from your account . Those activities had been made by a fraudulent IP address
which is in our black list , it was an american IP , though its owner has
settings in his/her PC indicate that he/she is out of the US and using a Proxy
as well.
This person tried to perform the following :
1 Transferring a high sum of money to another Wellsfargo user , with the
account # : 2013331604, First name : Jason , Last name : Korinek. ( Denied )
2 Changing password and other important information. ( Denied )
If you DID those processes yourself , or they have been DONE accidentally ,
please send an email to : 'LINK[wellsfraud.com'] ,
explaining why and how you did that , to get your account activated ,and to
permit us performing your processes.
Else, if that was not you , and you want get your account activated , kindly
read and follow the next to be in safe :
 Read this : 
We recently have created a new agent , prepared for such activities and for
contingencies , that is unknown specially to the unauthorized person who
logged into your account without your permission .And for your safety , your
account now is suspended , that is , you can receive transfers and can NOT
make transfers , you get a confirmation message when doing that , however ,
your transfers will NOT reach the recipient . Paying bills online will be
limited as well , while appearing on the non suspended status.
 Follow this : 
Verify your identity by logging into your account in the following site (and
you will be redirected to our agent) :
LINK[] , and filling the fields at the next
page . Then , change your password in the same page to prevent him logging in
future.
\ 
Q : How my account was accessed without my permission ?
A : Many reasons are available : 1st , some internet sites offer illegal
contents to attract visitors . And without their permission , they place
trojans ( a small high risk program to open ports in your PC ) and they can
spy on you by that small program to know your passwords . 2nd , you may
accept files from an unknown person that have the same mission . 3rd , you may
have accessed your online account via a public PC .
\ 
Thank you,

"ANZ Online Banking Alert
Dear user@example.com , 
 
ANZ is really concerned about our customers' security and therefore constantly
elaborates new comprehensive data protection methods. 
 
Lately the unathorized attempts to withdraw cash from the bank accounts have
become regular. 
We studied every fraudulent operation with duly care and managed to develop a
criteria list, helpful to detect a suspicious operation. 
 
Currently we have developed an electronic bank accounts access security
system, which is actually ready for implementation. The system follows the
a.m. criteria and in certain situations asks a Secret Question the account
holder has to answer. 
Alternatively the current transaction and the current account are blocked
unless the payment details are clarified. 
 
We kindly ask you to fill out the Additional Authorization Form, necessary to
activate the system.

request: Please follow the Member Verification Procedure (Second Notice) 
 
 
Dear eBay Member, 
 
Due to recent account takeovers and unauthorized listings, eBay is introducing
a new account verification method. From time to time, randomly selected
accounts (seller and/or buyer) are subjected to an advanced verification
process based on our merchant accounts/bank relations and customers credit
card. eBay may also request in an email message scanned/faxed copies of one or
more photo ID's. Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit
card/bank account is expired, or if you have changed your credit card number,
billing address etc. without letting us know about the change. 
Subject of this verification process are also the accounts that have unpaid
dues to eBay. 
Your account is not suspended, but if in 48 hours after you receive this
message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to suspend your
eBay registration. If you received this notice and you are not the authorized
account holder, please be aware that it is in violation of eBay policy to
represent oneself as another eBay user. Such action may also be in violation
of local, national, and/or international law. eBay is committed to assist law
enforcement with any inquires related to attempts to misappropriate personal
information with the intent to commit fraud or theft. Information will be
provided at the request of law enforcement agencies to ensure that
perpetrators are prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
 Note: If this is the second time you receive this notice, it might be
because you have made a mistake when you entered your details or that the
account was not updated at all.

Your account confirmation may go wrong if your credit card/bank account has
expired, or if you have changed/replaced your credit card without letting us
know about the change.
 Your account is not suspended, but if in 36 hours after you receive this message your account is not confirmed we reserve the right to terminate your Capital One subscription.
\ If you received this notice and you are not an authorized Capital One

to represent oneself as an Capital One user. Such action may also be in
violation of local, national, and/or international law.

"From Barclays Bank Plc London
Dearest, 
 
I am a member of Barclays Bank Plc here in London and I was asked to approach
you by my good friend,Vicky Williams.I am writing following an opportunity in
my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us though I know that you
are already made. 
 
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 167 million British Pounds
Sterling (One Hundred And Sixty Seven million, British Pounds) in an account
that belongs to one of our foreign customers, Late Mr.Morris Thompson an
American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only
daughter.You shall read more about the crash on visiting this websites. 
 
< 
 
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his 
next of kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because the 
Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or
a relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. 
 
Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only 
daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the
knowledge of this fund to claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I
and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you
upon the recommendation of Vicky Williams of your esteemed personailty and
release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for
safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we
don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed Bill. 
 
We agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as the supposed next 
of kin, while 5% out of the total sum is set aside for any expenses 
both party will incur during then completion of the transfer, and remaining
balance of 65% will be fo me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for
the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money
gets into your account. 
 
Please be honest with me and trust should be our watchword in this 
transaction. 
 
Note that this transaction is highly confidential and 100% risk free. 
 
On receipt of this mail, please contact me by return mail if you are 
willing to enter into this deal with me. I hope you can be trusted in this
regard as I am fully aware that you are an international figure hence this
approach. 
 
Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of 
these funds to you has been finalised. We will discuss much in details 
when I do receive your positive response. Please in your response 
include your direct secured telephone/fax numbers for a better communication
between you and me only.

# ACCOUNT ON HOLD: Please complete the verification process 
 
 
 
Dear Coustomer,
Sometimes eBay accounts are used to send email solicitations for transactions
outside of eBay, or to send unrelated questions in an attempt to discover your
email address. We wanted you to be aware of the potential fraud risk these
solicitations pose and encourage you to ignore the email you received from
this member. Sales that take place outside of eBay are not eligible for any
eBay or PayPal protective services and you run the risk of losing your money
or your item if you complete these transactions.
Our records indicate that you recently interacted with other ebay members
through the eBay email system and your account need verification. To speed up
this process, you are required to verify your personal information against the
account registration data we have on file by following the link below.
