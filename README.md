Program used to clean up the data of the Nazario Phishing Corpus (https://monkey.org/~jose/phishing/) for use in training neural networks.

To use this program the Nazario Phishing Corpus has to be downloaded and placed in a directory called mbox_edited (this can be altered in the code). Under certain circumstances, there can be encoding issues with a handful of the emails which would require manual removal from the corpus before running this program.
The output_files folder contains the cleaned up output generated by the program. With an individual .csv file for each respective .mbox file of the corpus.
A concatenated version of the entirety of the cleaned up data can be found in the root directory under the name all_mails.csv. This file was used as input data for the training processes of the networks found in the other repositories.

The script make_csv.py reads the HTML payload from the emails and converts the HTML to plaintext.
It also removes links and replaces them with placeholders. Both to protect from malware as well as to make the training process easier.
Other filtering steps include formatting as well as removal of as much non-natural language left after the plaintext conversion as possible.
The script saves the cleaned up data as a .csv after processing each .mbox file. After the last .mbox file is processed a concatenated .csv file of all emails is created.
